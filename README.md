## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
We propose a multilingual, AI-powered mobile and voice-assisted advisory platform tailored to the needs of small and marginal farmers in India. The platform will use a combination of AI, satellite data, real-time weather inputs, and computer vision to deliver personalized guidance on crop selection, fertilizer usage, pest control, and market trends. It will support regional languages, voice input/output, and a simple user interface designed for users with low digital literacy.

How it addresses the problem

* Personalized Recommendations: By integrating soil, weather, and historical crop data, the app provides scientifically backed advice tailored to each farmer's specific conditions.

* Real-time Updates: Weather alerts, pest outbreaks, and market prices are pushed in real time.

* Language and Accessibility: Support for regional languages and voice commands ensures usability by farmers with little or no literacy.

* Visual Diagnosis: Farmers can upload images of affected crops for instant pest/disease identification using AI.

* Market Linkages: Helps farmers track local mandi prices and connect with buyers.

Innovation and Uniqueness of the Solution

* AI-Driven Decision Engine using machine learning models trained on regional agricultural data.

* Voice-first Interface built on NLP models fine-tuned for regional dialects.

* Offline Functionality for regions with poor connectivity.

* Computer Vision Models for disease/pest identification through image uploads.

* Feedback-Loop System for model improvement based on user corrections and agronomist inputs.

* Modular Integration with government databases like soil health cards, crop insurance, and weather APIs.
## Technical Approach
Technologies to be used

* Frontend: Flutter (for cross-platform mobile app with offline support)

* Backend: Python (FastAPI/Django), Node.js for APIs

* AI/ML: TensorFlow, PyTorch (for pest detection and recommendation engine)

* Computer Vision: OpenCV, YOLOv8 for image-based pest/disease detection

* NLP & Voice: Google Speech-to-Text API, OpenAI Whisper, Bhashini (for Indian language NLP)

* Database: PostgreSQL, Firebase

* Cloud: AWS / GCP for scalable deployment and real-time processing

* APIs: IMD weather API, Agmarknet (for mandi prices), Government Soil Health Card API

Methodology and Implementation

1.User Onboarding

* Select language

* Input location (GPS or manual)

* Enter crop/soil history or auto-fetch via APIs

2.Core Features

* Crop & fertilizer advisory based on soil and season

* Real-time weather alerts and warnings

* AI-based pest/disease diagnosis via image upload

* Voice-enabled query and output in native language

* Market price tracking based on crop and region

* Notification system for reminders and advisories

3.Admin and Expert Dashboard

* Track usage, send custom advisories

* Analyze feedback and improve AI models

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility Analysis

* Technological Feasibility: All proposed technologies are mature and have been used in similar domains.

* Operational Feasibility: The app design is farmer-centric, and a modular rollout (starting with one region/language) allows for testing and scaling.

* Economic Feasibility: Open-source tools, public datasets, and cloud credits from platforms like AWS Activate make this solution cost-effective.

Challenges and Risks
Challenge                                               	Mitigation Strategy
Poor internet in rural areas	                            Offline-first app design with local data caching
Language barriers	                                        Voice & regional language support using NLP models
Inaccurate input data	                                    Use of AI to auto-suggest corrections; cross-verification with public databases
Model inaccuracy in pest detection	                      Human-in-the-loop validation by agri-experts
Low trust in tech	                                        Local language onboarding, pilot testing via NGOs and SHGs

## Impact and Benefits
